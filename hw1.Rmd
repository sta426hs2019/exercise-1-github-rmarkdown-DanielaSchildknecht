100 values are drawn from a lognormal distribution with mu = 1 and sigma = 0.25.

```{r sampling}

samples <- rlnorm(n = 100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = 0.25)
```
```{r hist, fig.show='hide'}
hist <- hist(samples)
hist$counts <- log10(hist$counts)
```
```{r plot histogram}
plot(hist, xlab = "x", ylab = "log Frequency", main = "Histogram of samples drawn from log normal distribution")

```

The mean of the samples is
```{r}
mean(samples)

```
and the variance of the samples is
```{r}
var(samples)
```
